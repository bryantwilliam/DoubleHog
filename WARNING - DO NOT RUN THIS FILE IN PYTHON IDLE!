Do not run this game in the python IDLE (python GUI). It needs to be run in the console interpreter.
In Microsoft CMD or a Unix Shell. If you do run it in the IDLE then it will create a continuous loop of terminals since
I used some operating system commands like clr for windows (CMD) and clear for linux (terminal).
To run this game simply double click on DoubleHog.py or run it with python(commandline)
