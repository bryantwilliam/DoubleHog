# DoubleHog
Double Hog

Double Hog is a fun dice game played using two six-sided dice. 
(Double Hog is a variation on the dice game ‘Pig’ (sometimes also called ‘Hog’))

Below are the rules for the game.
Players
Usually played between 2 people. 
Goal
The first person to reach 100 points is the winner.
Gameplay
On a turn, a player rolls the dice repeatedly until either:
•	a single 1 is rolled
•	the player chooses to hold (stop rolling)
If either of the above occurs, it is the next player’s turn.
Scoring
If a player rolls:
•	a single 1 – their turn ends and the total value of both dice is deducted from their score (eg if they throw a 1 and a 3, 4 is deducted from their score; 1+5 will mean 6 is deducted from their score
[NOTE: It is possible for players to have a negative score eg “-6”]
•	double 1s – player gets 25 points
•	other doubles (eg 2+2, 3+3) – player gets double points (eg 2+2 counts as 8; 3+3 counts as 12; 4+4 counts as 16)
•	in all other cases – the player gets the total of both dice (eg 3+4 counts as 7 points; 2+3 counts as 5 points)
Game End
When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, that player is the winner, and the game ends.
